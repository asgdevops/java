# Java comments

## Single line comments (_Java style comments_)

```java
// This is a single line comment
```

## Block comments (_C style comments_)

```java
/*
Here you can place a b clock comment,
as you can see, it can have multiple line.
*/
```

## Example:

```java
/*
    Antonio salazar,
    Learning Some Java 101,
    This is multiline comment,
    February, 2023
*/
public class CommentFun {
    /*
      main is the entry point to the application.
    */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Printing some stuff"); //displaying to console
        // This is a single line comment
    }//end main
}

```
